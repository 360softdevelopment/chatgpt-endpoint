# ChatGPT Endpoint

This is an HTTP REST API endpoint for ChatGPT, a conversational AI that uses GPT technology to generate human-like responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/icodealot/chatgpt-endpoint.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. Required variables are:
   - `PORT`: The port on which the server should run (default is 3000)
   - `PARENT_MESSAGE_ID`: The ID of the parent message, if any (optional)
   - `CHATGPT_API_KEY`: An API key for the ChatGPT service
4. Build the TypeScript code: `npm run build`
5. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage

The endpoint supports a single HTTP POST request at `/v1/conversation`. The request body should contain a JSON object with a single property, `prompt`, which represents the user's message to ChatGPT.

Here's an example of a valid request body:

{
"prompt": "Hello, ChatGPT!"
}

The response is a JSON object with a single property, `text`, which contains the response generated by ChatGPT.

Here's an example of a valid response body:

{
"text": "Hello! How can I assist you today?\n"
}
